My name is Xiaoyan Li, I'm majoring in computer graphic and machine intelligence at Purdue University. I'm seeking a position in game industy to exercise my skills as a opengl graphic engineer or game engine engineer. 
In purdue, I have learnt opengl, graphic related math for animations. And I took courses of networking, database and system programming to write game engines. To be well prepared, I also self-taught unity and "Game Engine Architecture" by Gregory. Furthermore, to achieve the best game in my imagination, I took machine intelligence track to understand how AI works. To make games is truely the only single reason why I came to US for college.
For me, coding and learning any concepts related to making video games is just fanscinating. In my opinion, Game is the process of learning and that is what human does. However, when the game evolves to video games, it is not only the process of learning, but also the combination of all the art that human ever created. And it becomes the nineth art, the entertainment of future. It's the game which let people really have a chance to interact with a fine designed production.
